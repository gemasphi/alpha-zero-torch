# alpha-zero-torch
A simple sequential generic pytorch alpha zero implementation.
Currently, the only game implemented is tic tac toe with varying board size and win condition length.

This alpha zero version is currently in version alpha zero and new features will be added over the next months.

Currently, there exist three branches in this repo:
* Master: contains a simple sequential pytorch implementaiton
* virtual_loss: master + monte carlo virtual loss
* cpp (work in progress): Contains the games and mcts and NN evaluation in c++ and the training in python
